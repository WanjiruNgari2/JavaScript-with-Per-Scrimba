# JAVASCRIPT WITH PER — SCRIMBA CODE-ALONGS

“Learning JavaScript shouldn’t feel like a lecture — it should feel like play.”
— Per Harald Borgen (Scrimba)

This repository contains my code-along projects from Mr. Per’s JavaScript course on Scrimba, made available through freeCodeCamp. 
I’m deeply grateful to both platforms for offering such an accessible and engaging learning experience for beginners.
Mr. Per’s humor, pacing, and hands-on approach made every session enjoyable .
From small quizzes hidden inside the lessons to practical projects that built my confidence step by step.

## OVERVIEW
Each folder in this repository represents a project or mini-challenge I completed while coding along with the course. These exercises strengthened my understanding of JavaScript through repetition, experimentation, and immediate feedback.


## Notable projects include:

BLACKJACK GAME — introduced core logic, conditionals, and arrays.

PEOPLE COUNTER APP — demonstrated DOM manipulation and event handling.

ERROR MESSAGING — Learnt how to automate error handling by using event listeners within functions.

SAVE LEADS CHROME EXTENSION — covered browser APIs and local storage.

INCREMENT / DECREMENT EXERCISES — practiced variables and control flow.

INLINE QUIZZES — short interactive tasks embedded in the lessons.



## TECHNOLOGIES & CONCEPTS

Language: JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
  
Key Concepts Practiced:
  
  *Functions and scope

  *Arrays and objects
    
  *DOM manipulation
    
  *Event listeners  
    
  *Local storage

  *Problem-solving through small, applied examples


## PURPOSE
This repository represents my personal learning journey in JavaScript — from basic syntax to building small, functional web projects. 
Each lesson built upon the previous one, helping me move from simply watching tutorials to understanding how each piece of code connects to real-world functionality.

## SOURCE MATERIAL
All projects in this collection were built while following the “Learn JavaScript — Full Course for Beginners” series taught by Per Harald Borgen on Scrimba, and featured on freeCodeCamp’s YouTube channel.

  Special thanks to freeCodeCamp for making this excellent resource freely available to learners like myself.

## FUTURE DIRECTION
I plan to continue expanding my JavaScript foundation by building independent projects, experimenting with APIs, 
  and later exploring frameworks such as React to strengthen my frontend development skills.
