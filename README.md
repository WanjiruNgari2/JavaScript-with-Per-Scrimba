JAVASCRIPT WITH PER ‚Äî SCRIMBA CODE-ALONGS

‚ÄúLearning JavaScript shouldn‚Äôt feel like a lecture ‚Äî it should feel like play.‚Äù
‚Äî Per Harald Borgen (Scrimba)

This repository contains my code-along projects from Mr. Per‚Äôs JavaScript course on Scrimba, made available through freeCodeCamp. 
I‚Äôm deeply grateful to both platforms for offering such an accessible and engaging learning experience for beginners.
Mr. Per‚Äôs humor, pacing, and hands-on approach made every session enjoyable ‚Äî from small quizzes hidden inside the lessons to 
  practical projects that built my confidence step by step.

OVERVIEW
Each folder in this repository represents a project or mini-challenge I completed while coding along with the course. These exercises strengthened my understanding of JavaScript through repetition, experimentation, and immediate feedback.
Notable projects include:


BLACKJACK GAME ‚Äî introduced core logic, conditionals, and arrays.

PEOPLE COUNTER APP ‚Äî demonstrated DOM manipulation and event handling.

ERROR MESSAGING ‚Äî Learnt how to automate error handling by using event listeners within functions.

SAVE LEADS CHROME EXTENSION ‚Äî covered browser APIs and local storage.

INCREMENT / DECREMENT EXERCISES ‚Äî practiced variables and control flow.

INLINE QUIZZES ‚Äî short interactive tasks embedded in the lessons.



TECHNOLOGIES & CONCEPTS

Language: JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
  
Tools: Scrimba, Visual Studio Code
  
Key Concepts Practiced:
  
  Functions and scope

  Arrays and objects
    
  DOM manipulation
    
  Event listeners  
    
  Local storage

  Problem-solving through small, applied examples


PURPOSE
This repository represents my personal learning journey in JavaScript ‚Äî from basic syntax to building small, functional web projects. 
Each lesson built upon the previous one, helping me move from simply watching tutorials to understanding how each piece of code connects to real-world functionality.

SOURCE MATERIAL
All projects in this collection were built while following the ‚ÄúLearn JavaScript ‚Äî Full Course for Beginners‚Äù series taught by Per Harald Borgen on Scrimba, and featured on freeCodeCamp‚Äôs YouTube channel.

Special thanks to freeCodeCamp for making this excellent resource freely available to learners like myself.

FUTURE DIRECTION
I plan to continue expanding my JavaScript foundation by building independent projects, experimenting with APIs, 
  and later exploring frameworks such as React to strengthen my frontend development skills.

Would you like me to create a matching repo description (the short summary under your repo name) and a one-line tagline for your GitHub repo card too? (That‚Äôs what appears on your profile grid.)
